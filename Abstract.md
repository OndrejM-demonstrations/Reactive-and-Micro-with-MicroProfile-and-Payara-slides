= Be reactive and micro with a MicroProfile stack 

MicroProfile, RxJava, React.js - what else do you need to build lightweight but robust reactive systems efficiently with opensource tools? Maybe something for effective data processing and distributed persistence? You can have it too with Kafka and Hazelcast. Now let’s have a look at how to assemble all together in almost no time, using Payara Micro. You’ll learn how to use a couple of simple tools to build a highly efficient, scalable and robust system that can be evolved continuously to meet rapidly changing needs and increasing loads.

== Info for organizers

I'm a core committer of the Eclipse MicroProfile project (microprofile.io), a member of the Eclipse foundation and work for one of the MicroProfile and Java EE vendors (Payara). I’ve also given a couple of talks about reactive programming with Java EE and Payara Micro. In this talk I’ll explain what the recent version of MicroProfile offers and how to combine Payara Micro, one of MicroProfile implementations, easily with other flexible tools like Kafka and Hazelcast. All with the aim to build a modern reactive application that uses resources efficiently and scales according to the actual load.
